    "For this project, my firm was retained by a well established mid-sized local real estate broker ('Client') from the King County region of Washington State, with offices located atop of historic Queen Anne 'hill' and overlooking lower South Lake Union. Client has a large staff of seasoned real estate profesionals, including agents, loan officers, lead generation experts, and other sales supply chain specialists ('Team'). Recently, Client has become aware of how its competitors have been leveraging the abundance of real estate data available about the King County market in order to gain competitive advantages.  In an effort to keep up with competition, Client approached this firm to gain similar insights. After a discussion with Client regarding the goals and what could be achieved, Client has narrowed its desire to **confirm, supplement and/or supplant** Team's preconceived notions about what truly drives residential real estate sales in King County.  Toward this end, Client surveyed its Team for their perspective on what primary factors they believe to be the most important drivers of real estate sale `price`; a list was then compiled and submitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the fact that Client seeks to understand the nature of the relationship between a continuous dependent variable, the `price` of real estate, and a multiple number of predictors, a multivariate regression analysis was recommended.  Client agreed to this initial statement of work. Client was advised and acknowledged that this analysis may ultimately lead to more questions that require additional steps in the future.    "

    "Even at this stage of the analysis, though incomplete and in need of further research, this report was a valuable first step highlighting the need for Client to prioritize the location of residential real estate as maybe the single most important predictor in a home's sale `price` in King County. In addition, the outliers of home `price` were a major factor impacting results and heavily skewed to the right.  Homes in King County could be easily be divided into three distinct categories, 1. Expensive, 2. Super Expensive, and 3. Only for Billionaires, with the latter being a very small subset of outliers that created significant OLS modeling issues with respect to this analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While at first glance, the size of a home and the size of the land it is situated upon, in terms square footage, would seem to be direct determinants of `price`, this analysis reveals that the nature of the relationships between those separate variables and `price` is likely to be nonlinear. Ultimately, tests for linearity were only passed once a log transformation was performed on the `sqft_lot` variable. "

    "## REVISION\n",
    "- The original version of this project was plagued by normality and independence issues.  There is a strong chance that the relationships between the variables and the target might not be linear.  In this version of the project, I am going to attempt to normalize the data by log transforming both the target and continuous variables.  I will then scale the price and other continuous variables so that the coefficients of the model are weighted similarly. Then we can see which features are having the most impact on price.  "

    "##  I.  Data Understanding and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### A.  Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this analysis was to provide Client with a linear lens for which to understand the most important independent factors impacting residential real estate `price` in King County and confirm its Team's fundamental understanding of the market. Given the number of different variables Client has requested we consider, a statistical multivariate linear regression analysis seems an appropriate First Step to discern the level of importance for how these factors all impact price.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### B.  Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Records and Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The scope of this analysis was limited to records of homes sold between 06-10-2021 and 06-09-2022.  Each record or ('row') in the data represents a home with a listed `price` determined by its most recent sale within the aforementioned time period.  Each column, except for the dependent variable `price`, represents an independent variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Data Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Based on survey responses and other direct input from Team, Client provided a list of independent variables hypothesized to be the most successful predictors for the `price` of residential homes in King County, without any ranking or grouping.  From that list, fields were populated from data available to the public on the [King County Assessor Data Download page](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx)('Baseline Data'). A full index of the factors ('columns'), including the target variable `price`, are located [here](http://localhost:8888/edit/data/column_names.md). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Notably, one of the survey responses by Client's team was ambiguously labeled \"location\".  As such, data in the `address`, `lat`, and `long` fields were retrieved using a third-party [geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Additional Data Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Signifant data exploration outside the Baseline Dataset was performed in an attempt to provide the model more diverse and useful information.  Ulitimately, the analysis utilized additional data obtained through the [King County GIS Open Data Site](https://data.kingcounty.gov/County-Operations/King-County-GIS-Open-Data-site/wuuf-xywg) regarding geographic points of interest.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### C.   Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The guiding principal underlying this analysis was the establishment of a Bayesian style iterative update process, beginning with an initial baseline multivariate linear regression model utilizing only the preprocessed Baseline Data.  From there, additional models were constructed by continuously incorporating new information, through both feature engineering and the use of additional data sources, while simultaneously maintaining, as much as possible, the fundamental assumptions of linear regression.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Summary A/B tests were performed over and over again. Models were compared to previous models, variables being reduced, expanded or transformed, and evaluated for gains.  By exhaustively testing all angles of any given model, even less performing models, the analysis  avoided a [greedy algorithm]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm') trap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "    All models were evaluated using an adjusted R-squared metric, a version of the popular closed form method of ordinary least squares.  The adjusted R-squared method is a relative metric that calculates the proportion of explained variance, while also taking into account the multivariate nature of the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. F-statistic and statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "    All features used in the model were ultimately validated using a traditional ANOVA based test for statistical signficance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mean Absolute Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "    Model performance was checked by direct error based metrics, including a calculation of the Mean Absolute Error('MAE').  MAE is a calculation of the average distance of total errors in the model regardless of whether they are positive or negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Root Mean Squared Error \n",
    "\n",
    "    Another error based metric used in this report was the Root Mean Squared Error - a calculation that takes the squared value of each individual error, sums them, and then takes square root of the total.  This metric is important because it gives errors greater weight based on their relative magnitude.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The Rainbow test was employed as a measure of residual linearity.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. The Omnibus and Jacques Barre tests were used to meansure residual normality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Iterative Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the [CRISP](http://localhost:8888/view/data/Capstone%20Project%20Introduction%20-%20AWS-DA.png) method as a guideline, Baseline Data was first collected, preprocessed and modeled, using only numerical data ('Baseline Model'). A lengthy data exploration process was then undertaken that involved numerious iterations and process permutations with constant remodeling and testing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This includes but was not limited to the following iterative processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualization of relationships between independent variables and the target variable. \n",
    "- Feature engineering, sometimes using additional data pulled in from numerous other resources. \n",
    "- Outliers were removed from numerical distributions and categorical data was one hot label encoded.  \n",
    "- Metrics from new models were measured against the Baseline Model and other model iterations \n",
    "- Independent variables were tested for multicollinearity and removed if found to improve model performance. \n",
    "- Residuals were visualized and examined for linearity, normality and homoskedacity.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Data Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, tests for normality and linearity continued to fail using the above procedures despite iterative attempts to clean and remodel the data. Due to the peculiar distribution of `sqft_lot`, it was selected for a log transformation. The log transformation successfully provided a final model that was linear.   "

Based on the Mean Absolute Error ('MAE') calculation, overall this baseline model is off by about an average of 381,082.49 dollars for any given prediction.  Nevertheless, when evaluating the Root Mean Squared Error ('RMSE'), that approximation is approaching almost double, at about 687,128.09 dollars off any given prediction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is statistically significant overall, yet it explains just about 41.2 percent of the variance in `price`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients for the intercept and all variables, except for `sqft_lot` and `floors`, are statistically significant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our intercept is about 6,337,000, meaning that a home where all our baseline values were zero, would cost about 6.3 million dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our coefficient for `Bathrooms` is about 130,000 meaning that for each additional 1 bathroom unit, the price of an average home should increase by about 130,000 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our bedrooms are negatively correlated at -168,700 meaning that for each decrease in 1 bedroom unit, the price of an average home's `price` should **decrease** by 168,700 dollars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following, we can interpret the coefficient value to mean the following: for each additional square foot of (variable), the price goes up by the amount of the coefficient, in dollars.  For example, in the case of `sqft_living`, the coefficient for `sqft_living` is 333.5127. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each additional square foot of living space, we expect the `price` of an average home to increase by about 333.51 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each additional square foot of above ground living space (`sqft_above`), the average `price` increases by about 295 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For each additional square foot of basement space, the `price` of an average home increases by about 168.38 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For each additional square foot of patio space, the `price` increases by about 269 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each additional square foot of garage space, the `price` **decreases** by about 156.17 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, for each additional one year increase in the years since a home was built, on average, there should be a **decrease** in `price` of about 3083 dollars. \n",
    "\n",
    "From each year since a home was renovated, there should be an increase in the `price` of the home by about 50 dollars.   \n",
    " \n",
    "##### ANALYSIS\n",
    "None of these figures are very helpful, and a huge amount of variance is unexplained by our baseline model.  The RMSE suggests that the residuals from outliers are having a massive impact on the models accuracy.  Construction of usable geographic location feature helps greatly.  "

    "### B. Engineering Geographic features\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the single most important confirmation from this analysis is that **location of a home is huge piece of the puzzle** when trying to understand what factors impact `price`.  Significant time was invested exploring outside data sources and engineering the most effective geographic location features for our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Neighborhood \n",
    "Initially, a feature called `neighborhood` was constructed from data scraped from a website called [ZipDataMaps](https://www.zipdatamaps.com/king-wa-county-zipcodes) and resulted in exceptional model performance over the baseline model.  This increased model performance to about 64 percent R-squared ('explained variance).  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### City \n",
    "When data was scraped from a website called [hometownlocator]('https://washington.hometownlocator.com/zip-codes/countyzips,scfips,53033,c,king.cfm') we were able to construct a `City` feature by filtering our `address` column for various City names.  After the City column was dummied out, model performance jumped even more, yielding an R-squared of about 68 percent of explained variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Zipcode\n",
    "Ultimately, the most effective iteration with a geographic predictor for `price` was the construction of a `Zipcode` feature engineered using the `address` variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, due to issues of multicolinearity, attempts made to use any of the above features in the same model together caused a significant increase in errors while causing performance to decrease.  "

    "The addition of several points of interest to the model proved to be somewhat effective in improving model performance. Using a python package called Geopy, distances between geographic points and the locations of individual homes could be calculated using their `lat` and `long` figures. The trick became finding several points of interest that were not too interrelated with eachother to create multicolinearity issues.  Attempts to do this same process were unsucessful with other packages such as Plotly and GeoPandas.  \n",

    "From the [King County GIS Open Data Site](https://data.kingcounty.gov/County-Operations/King-County-GIS-Open-Data-site/wuuf-xywg), a dataset containing about 5000 records of different geographic locations was downloaded, including their `lat` and `long`.  Fortunately, there was no need to merge or join the data with the base dataset. Instead we created a mask to filter our own dataset and create distances.  We chose three points of interest, though additional points could have been obtained and possibly more helpful.  Further research in this area would be advised.   "

The performance of Model1 is significantly better than the Baseline Model. The adjusted R-squared increased from 41.3 percent of variance explained to approximately 69 percent, while the MAE dropped to 242026.81 from 381082.49. This means that for any given prediction, we are off by about an average of 242026.81 dollars.  \n",

    "### B. The Impact of Outliers - Second Model\n",
    "Outliers have the second most significant impact on our model, besides location, but more importantly, they are preventing our model from being linear. The best results were obtained by removing all outliers outside three standard deviations, and then repeating the process a second time. Doing so lightens the tails and normalizes the distribution enough to bring outlier errors down significantly while increasing overall model performance, without excluding any more data than is necessary.  Beyond two iterations of this process, the laws of marginal utility drastically come into play, and the data loss is not worth the procedure.  "

    "Comparing this model ('Model2') to either Model1 or the Baseline Model, we can see that removing the outliers has had a massive impact on the overall performance.  Once again, Model2 is statistically signficant, like the Baseline Model and Model1.  However, now the adjusted R-squared calculation indicates that this model is explaining approximately 77.5 percent of the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, while our MAE only dropped from 242026.82 to 200450.82, our RMSE dropped signficantly from 498022.56 to 300816.55.  This means that the residuals in our outliers, which had an exponential impact on the performance of our model, have been greatly reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our RMSE, any given prediction under Model2 should be off by about 300,816.55 dollars.  "

    "The ('Final Model') showed massive improvement over the Baseline Model, and was even a slight improvement over Model2 as the adjusted R-squared indicates that the explained variance rose from 77.5 to 77.8. The final model is statistically signficant overall.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, `sqft_garage` and `sqft_patio` are no longer statistically significant, which makes me wonder if their relationship with `price` is indirectly tied to `sqft_lot` and/or `sqft_living`.  From a common sense standpoint, these fixtures/additions can either be attached to the physical structure of the home or detached and entirely separate.  Is a gazebo considered part of `sqft_patio` or `sqft_living`? Interaction terms or log transformations may be helpful in a future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Intercept\n",
    "Interpreting the y-intercept is probably useless given the contraints of this analysis.  The model distribution is still not normal, and no amount of scaling is going to make it normal. Realistically, there is probably no scenerio where all variables are zero. Nevertheless, if all predictors were set to zero, then an average house sold in King County would be worth -102 million dollars.  \n",

In this case, floors may either be affected by some sort of interaction or is still being influenced by outliers on the right side of the distribution, or perhaps decreasing marginal utility may have some role here, but in any case, it runs counter to the idea that more `sqft_living` should equate to a higher price.   \n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following, we can interpret the coefficient value to mean: for each additional square foot of (variable), the price goes up in direct proportion by the amount of the variable's coefficient, in dollars. For example, in the case of `sqft_living`, the coefficient is 77.39; therefore:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The most signficant increases in model performance were obtained through the engineering of geographic Zipcode feature, and three (points of interest) distance features. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performing a procedure twice over that removed outliers beyond three standard deviations, on most numerical predictors and on the target, greatly improved performance. This makes sense as King County is home to the founders and CEOs of many of the largest corporations in the World, including Amazon and Microsoft.  Homes sold at the high end are on an entirely different scale.        \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modest gains in performance were achieved through log transformations of `sqft_lot`, but was crucial in creating a truly linear model and achieving homoscedasticity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Further transformations and the introduction of interaction terms might have reduced errors and improved performance of the model further. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Nevertheless, the model failed tests for normality no matter what method was employed.  In addition, issues of multicolinierity persist and may be a symptom of the geographic feature engineering as a byproduct of spatial autocorrelation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Another issue is that the relationships between the variables may ultimately be nonlinear.  A brief review of existing literature on the relationship between land size, home size, and home sale prices suggests that both land and home size generally tend to have non-linear relationships with the `price` of homes.  Nevertheless, there is no accord on the type of nonlinear relationship as numerous studies seem to pose competing ideas and theories. Attempts to merge theories into a singular thesis have likewise been inconsistent. Most studies seem to agree that the relationship between land size and `price` display either a convex or concave shape, or both, at different size and price endpoints in the respective relationships [Non-linear Relationships between Housing and Price](https://www.proquest.com/openview/0d5f43724b49fb23393dacecd42c6911/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=27565). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ultimately, the most useful way to evaluate `price` may be to utilize another model altogether that does not require strict assumptions of independence, linearity and normality, or a model that can better evaluate and make use of the relationships that are nonlinear.  The method of [gradient descent](https://mlu-explain.github.io/linear-regression/) is an alternative open form of linear regression that contrasts to the Ordinary Least Squares method used in this report. Other machine learning models may likewise be promising alternatives to explore, such as a decision tree based method like Random Forest. In a review of literature, Wang et al. used support vector machines to build a housing price model; using a particle swarm algorithm to optimize the parameters of the support vector machine, and proposed the PSO-SVM model to predict housing prices [Real estate price forecasting based on SVM optimized by PSO](https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-c9b8281c-dba8-3701-8f1c-da1eae7adc10) Real estate price forecasting based on SVM optimized by PSO. Optik 2014, 125, 1439–1443. **As such, it is recommended that multiple approaches be explored through a more in depth meta-analysis, in conjunction with the continued development of this OLS model.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   The ease at which geographic tools were identified and leveraged as a means to unlock greater understanding for the differences between observed and predicted values in this attempt at an OLS linear model should not be ignored.  The exploding availability of online resources that geographically label areas, whether by zipcode, city name, neighborhood, distances/points of interest, or a multitude of other differentiating geographic attributes is an awesome resource at Client's disposal. **Regardless of what model is chosen, it is recommended that Client embrace the use of geographic criteria for sorting values into whatever model is used to predict home `price`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If the instant model is chosen for further development, then efforts should be made to obtain even more diverse factors that help explain variance in the model.** In this analysis, we only explored three geographic point of interest types: elementary schools, business centres, and clinics.  These were chosen primarily because they seemed less likely to be correlated with each other. Otherwise, these spots were arbitrarily chosen, yet a more sophisticated algorithm, ranking the different points according to a chosen set of values, could be constructed and evaluated.   For instance, Microsoft's headquarters is located in the heart of the Redmond neighborhood, and exists as a campus style community. As such, I would consider evaluating the geographic areas within that community for additional spatial areas that contain identifiable relationships between independent variables and `price`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **A more in depth look at some of the other categorical factors in this model may help explain more about what determines `price` in King County Real Estate.** With additional time, some candidates for interaction terms could be identified, such as `waterfront`, and could help explain additional variance in the model. King County has a great number of large lakes (Lake Sammamish, Lake Washington, Lake Union) and large sections of Magnolia, South Seattle Beach, and other parts of the County abutting Puget Sound.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Further feature engineering could be helpful.**  For instance, a deeper analysis of the `view` variable could help better delineate its relationship with `price`. Anyone who has ever been to Seattle knows that its obviously beautiful.  There are bald eagles on the telephone poles, blackberry and blueberry brambles growing along city fences, mountain ranges visible in virtually all directions. Mt. Rainier rises sum 14,000 feet from close to sea level, making it look larger than life. It is visible from hundreds of miles away, and from a great many Seattle vantagepoints.  A more specific `view` category might be `Rainier_View`.    "
