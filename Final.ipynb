    "For this project, I have been retained by the leadership of a startup online real estate analytics firm, BCF, LLC ('BCF'). BCF has requested advice for one of its newest clients, a mid-sized well established local real estate broker from the King County region of Washington State, located on top of Queen Anne ('Client'). Client has a large crew of seasoned real estate agents, loan officers, lead generation experts, and other sales supply chain specialists.  Client is currently exploring ideas to scale its business in the King County region and keep pace with newer, more technologically advanced real estate brokers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Toward this end, Client wants to obtain better data insights for its team by leveraging the abundance of real estate data available.  Client has approached BCF for a scientific perpective on what drives residential real estate sales in King County so that it can provide actionable reference points for its relentless 'direct to consumer' sales team. Client is requesting a multivariate linear regression analysis of the King County real estate market, with `price` being the primary dependent variable.  "

    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for the analysis is an effort to obtain a better understanding of what combination of independent factors are most impactful for residential real estate prices in King County. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on survey responses and other direct input from Client's sales team, Client provided a list of variables most likely to be highly successful predictors for the `price` of residential homes in King County.  From that list, most  fields were populated from data available to the public on the [King County Assessor Data Download page](https://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx). A full index of the variables ('columns'), including the target variable `price`, are located [here](http://localhost:8888/edit/data/column_names.md).  The `address`, `lat`, and `long` fields were retrieved using a third-party [geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/).  ('Baseline Data').  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The guiding principal underlying this analysis was the establishment of an iterative update process, beginning with an initial baseline regression model, that would continuously provide the model with new information, while simultaneously maintaining all fundamental assumptions of linear regression. Initially, Baseline Data was preprocessed  and modeled ('Baseline Model').  This was followed by a lengthy data exploration process which involved visulizing the different relationships between the independent variables and the target variable.  During the exploration process, several new features were engineered from existing data while additional data was obtained from the  scaled and cleaned for outliers, and then remodeled against\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geographic data retrieval \n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple websites were explored for sources of additional data, in keeping with the goal to provide diverse information that might be helpful for the model. Ultimately, the most important factor, other than the sheer square footage, was geographic location.  Several sources of geographic information were consulted, but ultimately, the best source of geographic knowledge was contained in the Zipcode information within the Baseline Data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the use of `Zipcode`, a dataset was taken from the [King County GIS Open Data Site](https://data.kingcounty.gov/County-Operations/King-County-GIS-Open-Data-site/wuuf-xywg) and includes a range of services, and location points were constructed based on the longitude and latitude of these locations. From there, we created distance measurements between the houses and those locations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial baseline regression model was built utilizing the base dataset. The second model iteration was built using the\n",
    "\n",

    "-which column is begin used as the regress\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The guiding principal underlying this analysis was to establish an iterative update process, beginning with the initial baseline model, that would provide the model with new information, while simultaneously keeping all independence assumptions  to the model in an effort to obtain a better understanding of what combination of independent factors are most impacting residential real estate prices in King County.  In keeping with this goal, significant efforts to maintain independence were made - independence between each independent variable and independence between each independent variable and the target. "
